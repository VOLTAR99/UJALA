# Monitoring : 
 View real-time data on light levels, motion detection events, and potentially other sensor readings (future upgrade) from the smart street lights.

# Lighting Schedule Management (future upgrade): 
  Set schedules for the street lights to turn on and off automatically based on the day of the week or create custom schedules for specific areas or events.

# Dimming Control : 
  Adjust the dimming level of the street lights remotely through the app, offering options like presets (low, medium, high) or a slider for granular control.


# Alert Settings: 
  Configure alerts received from the system, including notifications for:


  Potential system malfunctions.
  Exceeding pre-defined energy consumption thresholds (future upgrade).
  Emergency SOS (future upgrade): Trigger the nearest street lights to switch to high brightness and send real-time location data with emergency alerts to designated authorities upon activation.

  Real-Time Complaint Reporting and Acknowledgement (future upgrade): Report issues like malfunctioning lights or outages directly through the app, with automatic service ticket generation and real-time updates on acknowledgement and resolution time.

  Dynamic Light Control (Per Lamp) (future upgrade): (This might require additional hardware upgrades) Potentially control the light intensity of each street light individually through the app for specific situations or user preferences in designated areas.
